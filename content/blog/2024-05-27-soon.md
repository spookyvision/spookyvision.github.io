## More to come!

I'm planning to post about several Rust-centric topics soon, like:
- a measured response to [Leaving Rust gamedev after 3 years](https://loglog.games/blog/leaving-rust-gamedev/)
- improving the Rust developer experience
    - modularity in the language and cargo: papercuts and potential improvements
    - embedded: ~~stealing~~ copying what's awesome in Arduino and MicroPython
- playing with [wild](https://github.com/davidlattimore/wild), maybe?
